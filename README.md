# Social network with good features.
This is a social network project, using JavaScript (Express JS), MongoDB database, and using Auth JWT.

What is the challenge for me in this project -the Junior Challenge-:

The account privacy feature leads to changing the entire structure of the project, as if the account is private, its posts will be private, and vice versa.

This also affects the follower system. If you try to access a private account or its posts, you will have to follow it first.

### Getting started
To start using the project, you must follow these steps:
1) Create a register using name, email, password. Role and bio will be overridden with default values until the user changes them.

2) Create a login with the same data to take the token, and from here we can use the rest of the features.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them:
1) install Express
2) install jsonwebtoken
3) install Joi 
4) install mongoose 
5) install uuid
6) install bcrybt
7) install dotenv
8) install cors



### Middleware functions
Url error.
Message in every request, with url and method and time.
Handle auth.
